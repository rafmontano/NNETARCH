Description: Implements a hybrid forecasting framework combining nonlinear autoregression via neural networks (NNETAR) with volatility modeling using either a second neural network or a GARCH(1,1) process (via the 'rugarch' package). This package extends the 'forecast' package functionality to provide variance-adaptive forecasting models for financial and economic time series.
